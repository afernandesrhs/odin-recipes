    <h3>How to Make Fudge</h3>
    <p>This delicious fudge recipe is 
        easy to make in the microwave with just 3 ingredients: chocolate chips, 
        condensed milk, and butter. Add nuts, mini marshmallows, or candy before 
        chilling to make this treat even more decadent, or try peanut butter chips instead 
        of semisweet chocolate chips to make peanut butter fudge. If you want to have this 
        on hand for the holidays, double the recipe and use a 9x13-inch dish.
